# Sign-Up Form

A sign-up form for an imaginary service, originally created as practice with [intermediate HTML and CSS concepts](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css), especially [HTML forms](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css#forms).

This project was created as the [sixth practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) during my journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). Feel free to take a look at [my other projects](#other-projects) as well, including [my other projects with The Odin Project](#other-projects-with-the-odin-project).

## Viewing the project

You can try the project at the [GitHub Pages website](https://ali-aboulsauood.github.io/sign-up-form).

**Before you view the project**:

- This project is best viewed in a maximized [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) browser window on a `1920 x 1080` monitor. It is not guaranteed that other browsers, window sizes or resolutions will produce good visual results. Also, _This project is **NOT** designed for mobile browsers_.
- This project is merely a front-end without a back-end, for practice and demonstration purposes, which means that pressing the _Create Account_ button or the _Log in_ link will not work as expected from a sign-up form for a real service.
- You can find the original reference of the design and related design notes in a separate directory, [`sign-up-form/designs`](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/sign-up-form/tree/main/design).
