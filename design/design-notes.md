# Design Notes

The design of this version of [_Sign-Up Form_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) is based on:

1. The enclosed [design file](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/sign-up-form/blob/main/design/sign-up-form.png), which [online design file provided by The Odin Project](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png) in case any changes occur on their part.

2. The [design tips](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form#step-3-some-tips) listed by The Odin Project on the project lesson page, as of the time of writing these design notes.

_You can view the [lesson changelog](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/commits/main/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form.md) for more details_.

## Differences from the design file

The appearance of [the actual webpage in this project](https://ali-aboulsauood.github.io/sign-up-form) will invariably differ from that of the given design file, even in case no changes occur to the project specifications, mainly due to the following:

1. The project specifications lack details regarding many aspects of the design, such as lengths, fonts, font sizes, font weights, and others. I had to infer these myself or simply use the values I believed were the best from an aesthetic point of view.

2. Responsive design has not been yet covered at this point, and the design implemented in this version is optimized for a maximized [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser window on a monitor of a resolution of `1920 x 1080 px`.

3. I could not figure out how to implement the shadow effect that appears below the form and above the _Create Account_ button (compare the design file to the actual webpage).

4. I have added extra design elements not required as per the project specifications, such as hover and focus styles and placeholder text for form input elements.
